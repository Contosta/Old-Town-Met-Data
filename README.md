# Old-Town-Met-Data
Data and associated code for reading, filtering, and plotting data from meteorological towers installed in at the Demerrit Forest in Old Town, Maine, USA

#Variables include air temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, moisture, specific conductance, and snow depth

#Senors are a combination of "research grade" instrumentation from Campbell Scientific and "open source" instrumentation
#controlled by an Arduino Uno logger.
#The towers also monitor vegetation phenology with a phenocam, but these data are not included here

#There are two towers, one in a hardwood site, "the hardwood neighborhood", which is surrounded by a mixed deciduous and coniferous forest, and one in a softwood site in a "softwood neighborhood"

#Data are collected by Ed Lindsey and the Collaborative Research class, with the NSF MSB Vernal Windows project 
#and the NSF INSPIRES projects playing a supporting role
